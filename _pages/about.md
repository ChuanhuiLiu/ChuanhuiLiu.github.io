:raising_hand_man: Hi, I'm Chuanhui Liu (刘川辉), a final-year Ph.D. candidate in Department of Statistics at [Purdue_University](https://www.stat.purdue.edu/). Working with Prof. [Xiao_Wang](https://www.stat.purdue.edu/~wangxiao/), my research mainly focuses on latent variable models, variational inference, targeting applications in survival analysis and large language models (LLMs). I am a curious problem-solver with a hands-on approach, navigating challenges with logic and practicality, while seeking new skills and experiences. In my leisure time, I enjoy wok cooking:stew:, Riichi mahjong:mahjong:, and pixel art indie game:game_die:.
