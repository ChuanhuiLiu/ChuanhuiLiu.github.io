With the exponential growth of publications across disciplines, GenAI are now transforming the workflow of researchers. For example, LLMs can generate concise summaries, highlighting key findings, methodologies, and conclusions within seconds, which allows researchers to quickly assess whether a paper is relevant to their work. In this post, I share some examples of AI-powered research workflows.

### Summaries of Research Papers and its connected papers

### Difference between methodologies and setups

### Intelligent Question Answering on Research Papers
